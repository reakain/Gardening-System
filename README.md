Unity build out for 2D top down gardening system.

## What is?
Quick build out of the logic for a tile-based gardening system. This includes some sprite assets for states, and the setup to integrate a day and season tracker. Allows for customized plant growth as well.

## To-Do
 - For full functionality would need:
    - player animations
    - plant data database (including sprites)
    - Seasonal sprites
    - day tracker for season updates
